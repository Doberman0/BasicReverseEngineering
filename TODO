How to generate asm (.s) files (what sort of fool doesn't use a makefile?)

gcc -S -Og <filename>


N.B. When writing programs, make sure to write a basic file name (say, file1) and not something that's actually descriptive. 

N.B. Maybe expand upon this by adding an additional txt file which describes the asm and add a method for deducing the code.
    -> Perhaps add problem sheets in a similar vein to the Midterm?

N.B. Put on github
